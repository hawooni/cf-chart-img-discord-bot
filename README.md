# CHART-IMG DISCORD BOT

It is a simple Discord bot based on [CHART-IMG](https://doc.chart-img.com) API with serverless Cloudflare Workers. It supports all public TradingView symbols, and the preset symbols can be customized by modifying the file `config.json`.

You are welcome to use this bot if you don't want to customize your own. It will always run with the latest version.

## Requirement

- [Cloudflare](https://workers.cloudflare.com) Account
- [CHART-IMG](https://chart-img.com) Account API Key `CHART_IMG_API_KEY`
- [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications) Discrod Developer Portal `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`, `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`, `DISCORD_TOKEN`

## Setup

### Wrangler Install & Login

To install [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2), ensure you have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started) installed, preferably using a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues or to easily change Node.js versions, then run:

```
$ npm install -g wrangler
```

```
$ wrangler login
```

### Create Discord Bot

To start, you need to create a discord app through the [Discord Developer Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

- Visit https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Click `New Application`, and choose a name
- Copy your `Application ID` and `Public Key`, and put them in the file `wrangler.toml`.

- Now click on the `Bot` tab on the left sidebar, and create a bot! You can choose the same name as your app.
- Grab the `token` for your bot, and store it somewhere safe. (For security reasons, you can only view your bot token once. If you misplace your token, you'll have to generate a new one.)

### wrangler.toml

```
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID = "YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID"
DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY = "YOUR_DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY"
```

### Environment Variable

Create secret environment variables using wrangler secret.

`wrangler secret put DISCORD_TOKEN --env production`

```
$ wrangler secret put DISCORD_TOKEN --env production
